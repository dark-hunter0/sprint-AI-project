# Ngrok Deployment Instructions for the Heart Disease Prediction App

This file provides the steps to deploy the local Streamlit application and make it publicly accessible using Ngrok.

## Prerequisites

1.  Python environment with all project dependencies installed (from `requirements.txt`).
2.  A free account on the Ngrok website: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
3.  The Streamlit application file (`app.py`) is present in the `ui/` directory.

---

## Step 1: Install and Configure Ngrok

1.  **Download Ngrok:** Go to https://ngrok.com/download and download the version for your operating system. Unzip the file.

2.  **Authenticate Ngrok:** Log in to your Ngrok dashboard. Copy your authtoken. Open a terminal, navigate to where you unzipped Ngrok, and run the command from the dashboard. It will look like this:
    ```bash
    ./ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
    ```
    (On Windows, you may just use `ngrok.exe`)

## Step 2: Run the Streamlit Application Locally

1.  Open a new terminal or command prompt.

2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project (`Heart_Disease_Project/`).

3.  Run the Streamlit app and specify a port (e.g., 8501).
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui/app.py --server.port 8501
    ```
4.  Your application is now running locally. **Keep this terminal window open.**

---

## Step 3: Create a Public URL with Ngrok

1.  Open a **second, separate terminal** window.

2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the Ngrok executable.

3.  Start Ngrok to create a secure tunnel to the port your Streamlit app is running on (8501).
    ```bash
    ./ngrok http 8501
    ```

---

## Step 4: Access the Live Application

1.  Look at the output in your Ngrok terminal. You will see a line that says "Forwarding".

2.  Copy the public URL provided. It will look something like this:
    `https://<some-random-name>.ngrok-free.app`

3.  Share this URL. Anyone with the link can now access and use your live Heart Disease Prediction application.

To shut down the live app, simply close both terminal windows.
